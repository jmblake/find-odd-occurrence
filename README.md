## Dependencies
Only python3 and functools (which comes built-in) is required, and usually comes with most Linux distributions; if not, you can install dependencies with one of the following commands, depending on your package manager:
### brew
brew install python3.6
### apt
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
### yum
yum install -y python3.6
